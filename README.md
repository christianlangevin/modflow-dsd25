# Course Description
The purpose of this 1-day workshop is to introduce participants to recent additions and advanced simulation capabilities of MODFLOW 6. For each topic included in the training, there will be a short lecture on the underlying concepts and implementation, a live demonstration or exercise, or both. These exercises will use the Python language, Jupyter Notebooks, and the FloPy Package to create, run, and post-process MODFLOW 6 simulations.
